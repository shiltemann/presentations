# Jigsaw Genomics

---

# Completion of the human reference genome

- 2003: the over 3 billion basepair-long human DNA sequenced completely read for first time
- Marked a history moment in genomics
- Ushered in a new era for the field of Genome Analysis

You may remember reading about this in the News

# Data explosion


- costs kept dropping exponentially
- number of genomes analysed per year shot up

TODO: graph of sequencing cost dropping, number of genomes analyzed per year increasing

???
- This lead to an explosion of data, as sustained technical advanced cause the price of sequencing to drop at a staggering pace
- 3 billion dollars to sequence the first time, 1000 dollar genome reached in year X
- Now

# Analysis is hard

jigsaw metaphor

---

# What this meant for researchers

- from small datasets to data that no longer fit on thier computer
- from analysis on laptop to supercomputers
- from excel to linux programs for analysis
- "drowning in data"

# Bioinformatics was born

This created a new kind of specialist, bioinformatician

# Scaling analysis

not sustainable, number of bioinformaticians not growing at same pace as data

- need to find a way to scale up analysis

---

# Scaling the researcher

- efforts often focus on scaling up storage and compute capacity, which is important, but useless without experts to run analysis
- interpretation of analysis results becomes the bottleneck
- domain experts (researchers, clinicians, are the ones who know the data best, and interpret, we need to empower them to once again be able to analyze their own data, without relying on bioinformaticians

---

# Scaling the researcher

Achieving this requires several puzzle pieces

1. Make analysis easy
2. Training
3. Open science / best practices

---

# Galaxy

Platform for easy data analysis

- no installation, just a browser
- no complicated commands to memorize, just point and click
- bioinformaticians can easily make new tools available here


---

# GTN


---

# Visualisation

---

# Case study: Streeklab Haarlem

- diagnostics labs for infections
  - doctors send samples, to find out what sort of infection, and what treatment should be used
- always done without sequencing
- sequencing became cheap enough to


---

# Microbiota

Here we complicate the process even more, by sequencing not just one organism, but many

---

# MYcrobiota platform

- we created a Galaxy workflow together
- they run Galaxy on their own machines
- analyst upload data to Galaxy and get output report, make recommendations for treatment

message:

data explosion

how to scale the bioinformatician?

solution:  empower domain experts



structure:

This is Dana
  - works with DNA
  - used to be able to do analysis in excel
  - then human reference genome
  - now drowining in data

- Asks for bioinformaticians help
  - most tools require linux, programming skills
