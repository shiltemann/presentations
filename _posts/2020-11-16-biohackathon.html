# Biohackathon Goals

.left[
- Advance the development of an open-source infrastructure for data integration to accelerate scientific innovation


- Engage the technical people in the bioinformatics community inside and outside ELIXIR to work together on topics of common interest aligned to ELIXIR activities


- Strengthen the interactions with ELIXIR platforms and communities to establish and reinforce collaborations through hands-on programming activities.

# Hackathon Objectives

.left70[
- Two Galaxy workflows for visualization of analysis results on the diagrams of choice

- New capabilities for two user groups: Galaxy, MINERVA and WikiPathways, for better analytics and visualization of biomedical data

- An application using the COVID-19 RNA-Seq data (GSE145926)

- After the BH2020: a publication based on the outcomes of the project

# Results

- 3 new tools to [galaxytools-emc](https://github.com/ErasmusMC-Bioinformatics/galaxytools-emc/pulls)
- 1 update of [EGSEA IUC tool](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/pull/3295)
- Display application Galaxy -> Minerva

# PathwayViewer

- Cytoscape is UI application, so difficult to integrate into Galaxy
  - Need Cytoscape team to implement headless mode
- Started with **PathwayViewer** component
- Colored by DEG data

# MINERVA upload data overlay

- Upload data to MINERVA
- TODO: use Galaxy credentials system for username/password

# Future BioHackathon 2021

- In Barcelona (in person, fingers crossed)
- Recommend submitting a project proposal
  - If picked, they will pay for you to attend
  - Nice venue, nice social activities, nice way to find collaborators
  - AI, Deep learning, Galaxy, all interesting topics for ELIXIR
- Also one in Japan every year (August)
